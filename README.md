_{The Assignment_3_WebPage can be also called ther bird page website. In this website, users can gain information and knowledge about 5 specific birds which are Pardalote, purple Swamp Hen, White-headed Stilt, Inland Thornbill and Rose Robin. When accessing this website, user can view the description about the birds and pictures about 5 of them. Further, users can switch to dark mode on their screen by pressing the toggle button and enter their names to see the phrase "Hello, (their names)" in the heading of the pages. More information about the birds can be seeked in the link under "references". 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
